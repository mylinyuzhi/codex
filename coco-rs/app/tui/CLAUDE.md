# coco-tui

Terminal UI using ratatui with The Elm Architecture (TEA). Consumes `CoreEvent`
from `coco-query`; emits `UserCommand` back to core. Replaces TS Ink/React.

## TS Source

- `components/` (~389 files) — chat, permissions, tool displays, overlays, design system
- `screens/{Doctor,REPL,ResumeConversation}.tsx` — top-level screens
- `ink/` (~96 files) — custom React terminal renderer (replaced by ratatui)
- `outputStyles/` — output formatting
- `services/notifier.ts` — terminal bell/OSC notifications
- `utils/{theme,terminal}.ts`, `costHook.ts`, `dialogLaunchers.tsx`, `replLauncher.tsx`

## Architecture (TEA)

```
Model (AppState) ← Update (handle_event) ← Events (TuiEvent) ← View (render)
                                              ↑
                                         CoreEvent (from coco-query)
                                         UserCommand (TUI → core)
```

`App::run` is a `tokio::select!` loop multiplexing: terminal input (crossterm),
`CoreEvent` from agent, file-search/symbol-search results, animation ticks.

## Key Types

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `App`, `create_channels` | Run loop + channel constructor |
| `AppState` | Model: `SessionState` + `UiState` + `RunningState` |
| `state::SessionState` | Messages, tool executions, subagents, token usage, plan_mode, permission_mode, MCP servers, team |
| `state::UiState` | Input, overlay stack, scroll, streaming, suggestions, theme |
| `state::Overlay` | 30+ variants: ModelPicker, Permission, Doctor, Export, Feedback, CommandPalette, McpServerApproval, PlanEntry/Exit, Rewind, TrustOverlay, etc. |
| `TuiEvent`, `TuiCommand` | Message enum driving update; chord-aware command dispatch |
| `UserCommand` | TUI → core: SubmitInput, Interrupt, ApprovalResponse, ModelChange, etc. |
| `server_notification_handler::handle_core_event` | Fold `CoreEvent` into `AppState` |
| `render` | Pure `(&AppState, &mut Frame) → ()` — ratatui view |
| `StreamAccumulator` (re-export) | Stream deltas → `ServerNotification` for semantic display |
| `Theme`, `ThemeName` | 9 built-in themes plus custom `~/.coco/theme.json` palettes; hot-reloaded |
| `DisplaySettings` | TUI display prefs from `settings.json` such as syntax-highlighting enablement |
| `PasteManager`, `ImageData`, `ResolvedInput` | Paste buffering + image attachment |
| `Animation` | Spinner/streaming pacing |

## Event Flow

```
Terminal → crossterm::Event → TuiEvent::Key/Resize/Paste/Mouse
                                    ↓
                            keybinding_bridge → TuiCommand
                                    ↓
coco-query → CoreEvent ─────→ handle_core_event (fold into AppState)
                                    ↓
                            update → AppState mutation + optional UserCommand
                                    ↓
                            native surface draw (ratatui)
                                    ↓
                            UserCommand → coco-query (via mpsc)
```

See `docs/coco-rs/crate-coco-tui.md` for widget taxonomy, overlay catalog, and
snapshot-testing conventions (`insta`).

## Transcript Reader

`Ctrl+O` opens the transcript overlay as a cell-level reader. The projection
keeps lightweight `TranscriptCell` metadata for the full message list, while
the overlay renderer locates the visible cells from `TranscriptOverlay.scroll`
and only renders those cells into the buffer.

Expansion is selected-cell UI state only:

- `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` select expandable cells.
- `Enter` expands/collapses the selected cell.
- Expanded cells are capped internally by a fixed per-cell line cap.

Do not reintroduce a user-facing transcript expansion budget, `Ctrl+E` show-all
mode, or a full transcript `Vec<Line>`/`String` path for overlay rendering.

## Transcript Pipeline (tui-v2)

`src/transcript/` owns the v2 streaming→scrollback pipeline
(`docs/coco-rs/ui/tui-v2-design.md` §6.4): crate-internal `cells`
(`RenderedCell` / `CellKind` / `SystemCellKind`, engine-message grouping,
and the tool-commit boundary), `derive` (`Message` → cells plus tool-cell accessors), `render`
(committed history renderer + replay cache), `stream` (stable/tail splitter,
render key, watermark), `emission` (exactly-once tracker + the anchored
finalize). The finalize anchors streamed scrollback rows at the SOURCE level
(`text.starts_with(source_prefix)` + render-key gate) and appends only the
committed render's suffix — there is no rasterized per-row reconciliation;
soundness is pinned by
`transcript::stream::tests::test_stable_lines_are_row_prefix_of_full_committed_render`.
`src/surface/` keeps the per-frame drivers and terminal I/O. Do not reintroduce
per-row fingerprints on the stream path or a second streaming-only renderer.

**Single scrollback-commit owner (§6.7-10).** The fact "these stream rows are
already in native scrollback" lives in exactly ONE place —
`ScrollbackStreamCommit`, owned by `SurfaceStreamDriver` (`surface/stream.rs`).
The live-tail increment and the anchored finalize both read it
(`SurfaceStreamDriver::commit`); the finalize never keeps its own copy. It is
advanced only by a committed insert (`mark_stream_append_committed`) and cleared
only when those rows actually leave scrollback — `invalidate_commit` (replay /
reset clears scrollback) or `consume_commit` (the finalize folded them into the
message). A transient `streaming == None` frame must NOT clear it (that benign
clear re-committed already-present rows → duplication), and a replay must
invalidate it BEFORE re-preparing the live tail (else the wiped leading rows are
never re-emitted → loss). Do NOT reintroduce a second copy of this state on the
history driver.

## Transcript Invariants

The unified transcript refactor
(`docs/coco-rs/engine-tui-unified-transcript-plan.md`) pins three rules:

- **I-1 Authority** — `coco_messages::MessageHistory` is the single source
  of truth. Every transcript mutation emits one of:
  `MessageAppended` / `MessageTruncated` / `SessionResetForResume`.
  Helpers: `coco_query::history_sync::{history_push_and_emit,
  history_clear_and_emit, history_clear_and_emit_session_reset,
  history_replace_and_emit}`. Direct `history.clear()` / `history.messages = ...`
  in production code is a bug — observers desync.
- **I-2 Derived view** — `TranscriptView.cells` is a pure derivation
  from `&Message` via `transcript::derive::message_to_cells`. Renderers read
  cells; never mutate cells in place.
- **I-3 UI-only state stays UI-only** — `ui.streaming`,
  `session.tool_executions`, modals, toasts. Not part of transcript.

## Modal Pane Architecture

Full-screen modal behavior lives in `src/modal_pane/`; bottom-pane prompt
behavior lives in `src/bottom_pane/`. `update/interaction.rs` is only the
precedence shell: prompt-first for approve/deny/filter/nav, modal-first for
confirm, with autocomplete still handled before prompt/modal routing.

Modal-specific key maps live with the modal behavior (`model_picker`,
`team_roster`, `settings`, `permissions_editor`). Keep the `/permissions`
editor as its own modal-pane module: it has list, add-form, and delete-confirm
modes and must not be flattened into generic picker behavior. The skills,
agents, and plugin dialog interceptors remain in `update/` until their
surfaces are migrated.

### Reasoning metadata (side-cache pattern, no I-2 exception)

The engine emits `ServerNotification::ReasoningMetadataAttached
{ message_uuid, duration_ms, reasoning_tokens }` right after
`TurnCompleted` whenever the model reported non-zero reasoning
tokens. The TUI handler stamps `SessionState.reasoning_metadata`
keyed by `message_uuid` (`O(1)`, no cell-walk). Renderers read
`Thinking · <duration> · <tokens>` from the side-cache; the
`RenderedCell` itself remains a pure function of `&Message` (I-2
preserved). The cache is pruned on `MessageTruncated` /
`SessionResetForResume` so it cannot outlive its anchor.
