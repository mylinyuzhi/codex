//! UI-only ephemeral state that needs cross-handler scope but is not
//! conversation/engine state.
//!
//! Lives here so [`crate::state::SessionState`] doesn't accumulate
//! render-only fields. Each entry exists because some handler stamps
//! a timestamp / sample that a later render consumes — the data is
//! truly local to the TUI; the engine never reads it.
//!
//! ## Turn-lifecycle state is grouped into [`RunningTurn`]
//!
//! The fields that only make sense while an LLM turn is running
//! (`started_at`, `verb`, pause accumulator, current-pause anchor,
//! live token estimate)
//! live inside a single [`RunningTurn`] struct accessed through
//! [`UiEphemeralState::turn`]. Storing them as `Option<RunningTurn>`
//! instead of four independent `Option<…>` fields makes illegal
//! combinations (e.g. `verb = Some` with `started_at = None`)
//! unrepresentable — the type itself enforces the invariant that
//! [`crate::server_notification_handler::protocol`] used to enforce
//! by convention.
//!
//! ## Reset boundaries
//! - The turn-lifecycle fields rotate with the wire-level lifecycle:
//!   [`UiEphemeralState::start_turn`] at `TurnStarted`, then
//!   [`UiEphemeralState::end_turn`] at any terminal turn event. The
//!   final `total_paused_ms` is preserved in
//!   [`UiEphemeralState::last_total_paused_ms`] so a stalled paint
//!   between the terminal event and the next frame still resolves to
//!   a consistent elapsed value.
//! - `task_completion_timestamps` and `tasks_all_completed_since_ms`
//!   reset on the per-task diff in the `TaskPanelChanged` handler.
