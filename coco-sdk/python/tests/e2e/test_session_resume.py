"""End-to-end: session persistence + ``session/resume`` round-trip.

Drives a turn against the live SdkServer, then asserts:

1. ``list_sessions`` reports the just-completed session — proves the
   server persisted it through ``SessionManager``.
2. A ``session/resume`` request for that session id returns a session
   metadata payload (carries ``session_id`` + ``cwd`` + ``model``).

Both checks happen *inside the same client lifecycle* (one binary
spawn, one ``SessionManager`` tempdir). A two-spawn cross-process
resume needs the test target to honor ``COCO_SDK_STDIO_SESSIONS_DIR``
so both spawns share storage; that's a future enhancement and not
needed to prove the resume RPC itself works.

We bypass ``CocoClient.resume`` deliberately: it exposes resume as an
async iterator over ``events()``, but ``session/resume`` is a sync RPC
in coco-rs (it returns session metadata, no follow-up notifications),
so iterating events would produce nothing. Going through
``_send_and_await_response`` matches the actual wire semantics.
