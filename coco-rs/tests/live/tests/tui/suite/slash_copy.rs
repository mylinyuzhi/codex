//! `/copy` slash command — TUI-only side effect, must never reach the
//! agent. The handler chain is:
//!
//! ```text
//!  submit("/copy") → take_input → try_local_command(/copy)
//!                                 ↳ clipboard::copy_last_message
//!                                 ↳ Toast appended
//!                                 returns true
//! ```
//!
//! The branch before the engine ever sees the input. Verifies:
//! - After the slash submission, the model call_count does NOT advance
//!   (no follow-up turn was scheduled).
//! - A toast was appended (success or error — we don't depend on the
//!   real clipboard surface; arboard/OSC52 may either succeed or fail
//!   in a headless test runner, both produce a toast).
//! - `/copy` is not folded into `session.messages` as a user prompt
//!   (it's a TUI-only command, not user content).
