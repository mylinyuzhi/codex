//! Provider-credential resolution seam (dependency inversion).
//!
//! `coco-inference` owns this trait + the coco-neutral [`SubscriptionCreds`]
//! carrier. The implementor (`coco-provider-auth`) depends on this crate; this
//! crate does **not** depend back — the auth service stays out of the inference
//! dependency graph and tests can use a fake resolver.
//!
//! The carrier is intentionally provider-neutral (no `vercel-ai-*` type crosses
//! the seam — that would trip `scripts/check-vercel-ai-seam.sh`). `model_factory`
//! (which already depends on `vercel-ai-openai`) adapts it into the provider
//! crate's wire-auth mode (`vercel_ai_openai::OpenAIAuth::ChatGptSubscription`).
