//! Telemetry integration trait.
//!
//! This module defines the `TelemetryIntegration` trait that allows
//! custom telemetry backends to receive lifecycle events from
//! generate_text, stream_text, and other functions.
//!
//! Uses the same callback event types as user callbacks,
//! matching the TS SDK design.

/// Implement this trait to receive lifecycle events from AI SDK functions.
