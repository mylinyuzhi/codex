//! Turn-end memory extraction service.
//!
//! After every eligible turn, fork a subagent with a 5-turn cap and
//! a memdir-only write fence. The agent reads existing memories
//! (manifest pre-injected into its prompt), then writes / edits
//! memory files based on the conversation slice since the last cursor.
//!
//! State machine:
//! - throttle gate (every Nth turn)
//! - mutual exclusion (don't run while in-flight; stash + trailing run)
//! - skip-if-main-already-wrote (`has_memory_writes_since`)
//! - cursor advance after success
//!
//! ## Cancellation safety
//!
//! Without a Drop guard the `in_progress` flag stays `true` for the
//! rest of the session, wedging every subsequent `maybe_extract` call
//! into `Skipped(InProgress)` until process restart.
//!
//! The fix: hold `in_progress` in a sync `Arc<AtomicBool>` and wrap
//! it in [`InProgressGuard`] (RAII). The guard's `Drop` synchronously
//! clears the flag, so a cancelled `maybe_extract` future can't leak
//! the flag. The atomic also lets `wait_for_in_progress_clear` (and
//! the watch channel signalling) read state without an `.await`.
