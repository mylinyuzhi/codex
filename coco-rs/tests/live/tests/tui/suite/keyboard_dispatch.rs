//! End-to-end keystroke routing.
//!
//! Drives the same path `App::handle_event` exercises in production —
//! `crossterm::KeyEvent` → `keybinding_bridge::map_key` →
//! `update::handle_command` → `UserCommand` on the wire. Verifies the
//! TUI actually reaches the engine via real keystrokes (not just by
//! calling `submit()` directly).
//!
//! Exercised here:
//! - Typing "hi" (two `Char` keys) builds the input buffer.
//! - `Enter` flushes the buffer through `TuiCommand::SubmitInput`,
//!   which both folds a user `ChatMessage` into AppState and emits
//!   `UserCommand::SubmitInput` to the agent driver.
//! - `Shift+Tab` cycles `permission_mode` and emits
//!   `UserCommand::SetPermissionMode` (the gateway used by the
//!   permission-cycling overlay flow).
