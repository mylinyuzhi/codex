//! Typed cross-turn shared state carried on `ToolUseContext.app_state`.
//!
//! This struct replaces a previously untyped `serde_json::Value` map. It
//! is shared between `coco-tools` (writers: EnterPlanMode/ExitPlanMode),
//! `coco-query` (reader+writer: PlanModeReminder), and the `coco-cli`
//! driver (writer: ClearConversation + reader: auto-title gate).
//!
//! TS parity: `appState.toolPermissionContext` in `state/AppStateStore.ts`.
//! TS keeps the live permission-mode + plan-mode latches on a single
//! shared-mutable store; readers call `getAppState()` fresh and writers
//! use `setAppState(prev => ...)` to mutate. Rust mirrors this via
//! `Arc<RwLock<ToolAppState>>` on the engine + every tool context.
//!
//! All fields are plain value types so `Default` produces the initial
//! empty state; adding a field is a one-line edit here, not a string key
//! coordination across three crates.

// Tools thus cannot call `.write()` on app_state from inside
// `execute()`; the type system prevents it.
//
// Mutations flow through `ToolResult::app_state_patch`: a boxed
// `FnOnce(&mut ToolAppState)` that the executor applies post-execute
// (serial) or post-batch (concurrent) under a single write lock.
// This matches TS `orchestration.ts:queuedContextModifiers` exactly:
// tools return a `(ctx) => newCtx` modifier; the orchestrator queues
// them per tool_use_id and applies after the concurrent batch. No
// tool can observe another tool's mutation mid-batch, and no tool
// can directly mutate the shared store.

/// Read-only handle to the shared [`ToolAppState`]. Tools receive
/// this on [`crate::ToolUseContext::app_state`] and can query live
/// state via [`AppStateReadHandle::read`]. Mutations are **not**
/// exposed — tools return an [`AppStatePatch`] through
/// [`crate::ToolResult::app_state_patch`] instead.
///
/// TS parity: `appState.toolPermissionContext` is visible via
/// `context.getAppState()`, but writes go through
/// `context.setAppState(...)` which the orchestrator funnels into
/// `queuedContextModifiers` for post-batch apply. Rust's type
/// system enforces the same discipline: the handle has no write
/// surface at all, so a tool that tries to mutate simply won't
/// compile. Elegant over documented.
