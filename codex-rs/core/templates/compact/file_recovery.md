You are performing a CONTEXT CHECKPOINT COMPACTION with FILE CONTEXT PRESERVATION.

Create a handoff summary for another LLM that will resume the task, structured as follows:

## Technical Context
Development environment, tools, frameworks, and configurations in use. Programming languages, libraries, and technical constraints. File structure, directory organization, and project architecture.

## Project Overview
Main project goals, features, and scope. Key components, modules, and their relationships. Data models, APIs, and integration patterns.

## Code Changes
Files created, modified, or analyzed during our conversation. Specific code implementations, functions, and algorithms added. Configuration changes and structural modifications.

## Debugging & Issues
Problems encountered and their root causes. Solutions implemented and their effectiveness. Error messages, logs, and diagnostic information.

## Current Status
What we just completed successfully. Current state of the codebase and any ongoing work. Test results, validation steps, and verification performed.

## Pending Tasks
Immediate next steps and priorities. Planned features, improvements, and refactoring. Known issues, technical debt, and areas needing attention.

## User Preferences
Coding style, formatting, and organizational preferences. Communication patterns and feedback style. Tool choices and workflow preferences.

## Key Decisions
Important technical decisions made and their rationale. Alternative approaches considered and why they were rejected. Trade-offs accepted and their implications.

**Important Files:** The conversation included work on several files that will be automatically recovered below to maintain development context.

Focus on information essential for continuing the conversation effectively, including specific details about code, files, errors, and plans.
