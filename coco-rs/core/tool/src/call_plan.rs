//! Scheduler DTOs for the `ToolCallRunner` / `StreamingToolExecutor`
//! boundary.
//!
//! TS parity: I12 of `docs/coco-rs/agent-loop-refactor-plan.md`. The
//! runner returns an **unstamped** outcome carrying everything except
//! `completion_seq`; the executor stamps the completion sequence at
//! surface time — the moment the `run_one` future resolves for a
//! `Runnable` plan, or when the partitioner reaches an `EarlyOutcome`
//! barrier block.
//!
//! Keeping the DTOs in `coco-tool` (L3, the interface crate) rather
//! than `coco-query` (L5) preserves the dependency direction: the
//! executor lives in `coco-tool`, so it must not reference `coco-query`
//! types. `coco-query` owns the `ToolCallRunner` implementation and
//! the message-bucket helpers; the executor schedules and stamps.
//!
//! This module is currently scaffolding — no production code path in
//! coco-rs consumes it yet. Phase 4d (the `run_one` rewire) is the
//! first consumer. Dead-code warnings are suppressed on the whole
//! module because the helper is already exercised by the companion
//! `call_plan.test.rs` and will be wired into the runner in the next
//! step.
