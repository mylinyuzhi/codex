//! Workspace-scoped shared secret.
//!
//! TS: `bridge/workSecret.ts`. The secret is generated once per
//! workspace (keyed by the absolute path) and stored in the user's
//! keychain; it's what the IDE and CLI exchange to prove they belong
//! to the same trust domain. The JWT layer uses it as the HS256 key.
//!
//! This module owns just the **derivation** of the secret — the actual
//! keychain persistence is delegated to `coco-keyring-store`, which is
//! a dependency this crate doesn't pull in (we'd need OS-specific
//! backends). Callers (usually the bridge server or CLI bootstrap)
//! combine `derive_secret_from_material` with their own storage.
