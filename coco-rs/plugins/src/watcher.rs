//! Plugin change detection.
//!
//! TS parity: `useManagePlugins.ts:285-303` watches plugin settings on
//! disk and shows a "Plugins changed. Run /reload-plugins to activate."
//! notification — never auto-reloads. Coco-rs mirrors the user-facing
//! behaviour with a debounced file watcher across the plugin scopes
//! (user / project / managed) plus the `installed_plugins.json` ledger.
//!
//! The watcher is intentionally *not* hooked into the [`crate::PluginManager`]
//! refresh path — that's the explicit `/reload-plugins` user action. This
//! module only surfaces the *fact* that something changed.
//!
//! ## Reuse note
//!
//! This module is a *thin* wrapper around [`coco_file_watch::FileWatcher`]:
//! it supplies the classify/merge closures and the plugin-scope path list.
//! Subscription, throttling, the OS-event pump, and per-path bookkeeping
//! all live in `coco-file-watch`. The wrapper exists solely so callers
//! can ask for "the plugin watcher" without re-stating the policy.
