//! Network proxy for sandboxed command network filtering.

//! Provides HTTP CONNECT and SOCKS5 proxy servers that enforce
//! domain-based allow/deny filtering for sandboxed commands.
//! On Linux, includes socat-based bridges for proxy access across
//! network namespaces created by bubblewrap `--unshare-net`.

/// Async callback invoked by the egress proxy when a CONNECT targets a host the

/// the installed [`bridge::SandboxApprovalBridge`] only when one is present, so
/// the unbridged path stays fail-closed.

/// Mirrors TS `createSandboxAskCallback` (`cli/structuredIO.ts`) which surfaces
/// "Allow network connection to {host}?" on a denied CONNECT. Host-only payload
/// matches the TS `SandboxNetworkAccess` tool input `{ host }`.
