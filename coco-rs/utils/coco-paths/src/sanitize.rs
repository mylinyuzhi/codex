//! Path-segment sanitization helpers — TS-exact parity.
//!
//! TS source:
//! - `utils/sessionStoragePortable.ts:311-319` `sanitizePath` — the
//!   general-purpose sanitizer used for project paths, memory base, and
//!   any other arbitrary string used as a directory name.
//! - `tools/AgentTool/agentMemory.ts` `sanitizeAgentTypeForPath` — only
//!   the `:` separator (used by plugin-namespaced agent ids like
//!   `my-plugin:my-agent`) is replaced; the rest of the agent type is
//!   already constrained upstream and passes through untouched.

/// Sanitize an arbitrary string for use as a single filesystem path
/// segment, mirroring TS `sanitizePath` exactly.
///
/// Algorithm:
/// 1. Iterate the input as UTF-16 code units (matching JS string
///    semantics) and replace every code unit outside `[a-zA-Z0-9]`
///    with `'-'`. A char outside the BMP (e.g. an emoji) therefore
///    becomes two `-` chars — same as JS regex behaviour.
/// 2. If the result has at most [`MAX_SANITIZED_LENGTH`] bytes
///    (which equals char count here since every surviving byte is
///    ASCII), return it.
/// 3. Otherwise truncate to [`MAX_SANITIZED_LENGTH`] and append
///    `-{simple_hash(original_input)}` where `simple_hash` is djb2
///    formatted base36.
///
/// Hash strategy note: TS picks `Bun.hash` on Bun and `simpleHash`
/// (djb2) on Node. We match Node — djb2 is a deterministic pure
/// function that ports cleanly. Long paths therefore round-trip
/// identically between coco-rs and TS-on-Node, but **may diverge
/// from TS-on-Bun**; this is the documented trade-off.
