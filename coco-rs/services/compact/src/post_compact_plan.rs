//! Post-compact plan-file re-injection.
//!
//! TS: `createPlanAttachmentIfNeeded()` in `compact.ts:1470-1486`. After
//! compaction clears history, this function re-injects the current plan
//! file's contents so the model can continue working on the plan it had
//! been following before the context boundary.
//!
//! The attachment is wrapped in `<system-reminder>` (TS
//! `createAttachmentMessage` of type `plan_file_reference`) and renders the
//! verbatim text template from `messages.ts:3636-3642`.
//!
//! Engine calls this alongside [`crate::create_post_compact_file_attachments`]
//! during the full-compact flow.
