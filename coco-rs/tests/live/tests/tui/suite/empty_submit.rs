//! Empty-submit guard: `update::edit::submit` short-circuits when the
//! input buffer is empty — no `UserCommand::SubmitInput` is sent, no
//! user `ChatMessage` is appended, the engine never runs. Belt-and-
//! suspenders defense against accidental Enter on an idle prompt.
//! Verifies all three:
//!
//! - `state.session.messages` stays empty (no phantom user entry).
//! - `state.ui.input.text` stays empty (nothing to flush).
//! - The event channel stays silent for a short grace window —
//!   the engine should not have been invoked.
//! - `ScriptedModel::call_count() == 0` confirms `do_generate` /
//!   `do_stream` was never reached.
