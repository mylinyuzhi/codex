//! Interrupt mid-flight — exercises the `UserCommand::Interrupt` path
//! through the real TUI driver against a real LLM.
//!
//! The test asks the agent to start a slow Bash command (`sleep 10`).
//! While the engine is awaiting tool output, the test fires an
//! Interrupt. The driver's active-turn cancel token cascades through
//! every `tokio::select!` arm in the engine; the turn returns and
//! the harness sees `SessionResult` quickly.
//!
//! Two timing properties this proves:
//! 1. The interrupt actually propagates — without it, the test would
//!    hang waiting for `sleep 10` to finish.
//! 2. Cancellation flushes a `SessionResult` through the event channel
//!    so the production TUI's "ready for next prompt" cue still fires
//!    after Esc/Ctrl+C.
