//! Post-stream recovery dispatcher.
//!
//! Owns the decision tree that runs when [`crate::engine_stream_consume`]
//! signals a [`WithheldReason`]: the model produced an `assistant_msg`
//! whose stop reason maps to a recoverable bucket, and we now decide
//! whether to retry (compaction / output-budget escalation /
//! resume-nudge) or surface the synthetic `api_error` message and
//! fall through to the no-tool-calls terminal.
//!
//! ## TS source
//!
//! Mirrors the `!needsFollowUp` block at `query.ts:1062-1255`, adapted
//! to multi-provider semantics:
//!
//! - TS distinguishes "withheld 413" (prompt-too-long) from "withheld
//!   max_output_tokens" via Anthropic-specific predicates
//!   (`isPromptTooLongMessage`, `isWithheldMaxOutputTokens`). coco-rs
//!   pre-maps every provider's signal into the typed
//!   [`coco_messages::StopReason`] at the `vercel-ai-*` adapter seam,
//!   then collapses it to a [`WithheldReason`] in
//!   `engine_stream_consume::withhold_reason_for_stop`. The
//!   dispatcher matches the typed enum — never the raw provider
//!   string.
//! - TS's `ESCALATED_MAX_TOKENS = 65536` magic number is Anthropic-Opus-
//!   specific. coco-rs reads
//!   [`coco_config::ModelInfo::max_output_tokens_escalate`] — a per-model
//!   opt-in ceiling. When unset, Phase-1 escalate is **disabled** for
//!   that model and recovery jumps straight to the multi-turn resume
//!   nudge (Phase-2). The TS `ESCALATED_MAX_TOKENS` constant and the
//!   per-turn `max_tokens_override` state field both went away with this
//!   refactor — escalate is now a derived property of `ModelInfo`
//!   + the per-turn `transition` field, not a stateful slot.
//! - TS's `recoverFromOverflow` (collapse drain) is intentionally
//!   excluded — `coco-rs/CLAUDE.md` rejects `CONTEXT_COLLAPSE` /
//!   `HISTORY_SNIP` as out-of-scope per the multi-provider audit.
//!
//! ## Withhold semantics (Finding C4 / C22)
//!
//! TS withholds the synthetic api_error message **during** the stream
//! and only yields it on recovery exhaustion. Rust's current behavior
//! (pre-commit-3) pushed the synthetic immediately at every stop
//! reason, producing phantom error messages on the happy compact-retry
//! path. The dispatcher fixes this by:
//!
//! - **`PromptTooLong`**: pushes `assistant_msg` (partial response
//!   remains visible) and triggers reactive compaction; no synthetic
//!   push. `do_reactive_compact`'s circuit breaker may no-op when
//!   compaction has already fired recently — the next turn surfaces
//!   the same condition naturally without a phantom message.
//! - **`MaxOutputTokens` escalate**: pushes neither the partial
//!   `assistant_msg` (would be reused by the retry's bigger budget)
//!   nor the synthetic (would precede a successful retry's clean
//!   response).
//! - **`MaxOutputTokens` recover**: pushes `assistant_msg` (partial
//!   output visible to the model on the resume turn) + the meta
//!   "resume" nudge; still no synthetic until exhaustion.
//! - **`MaxOutputTokens` exhausted**: pushes `assistant_msg` + the
//!   synthetic, then falls through. This is the only path that emits
//!   the synthetic — TS parity at `query.ts:1255` (`yield lastMessage`
//!   after exhausting the recovery loop).
//!
//! ## ContentFilter
//!
//! Not a [`WithheldReason`] — refusal is a terminal policy decision,
//! not a recoverable provider error. ContentFilter is handled inline
//! at the dispatch site in `engine.rs` (push assistant + synthetic,
//! fall through). The [`crate::engine_stream_consume::withhold_reason_for_stop`]
//! function returns `None` for it on purpose, and the
//! `isApiErrorMessage` short-circuit in commit 5 prevents Stop hooks
//! from cycling on the refusal.
