//! Plan-approval protocol messages exchanged between teammates and team
//! leads via the mailbox. Producers:
//! - teammate `ExitPlanModeTool` serializes [`PlanApprovalRequest`] and
//!   writes it to the lead's inbox (TS: ExitPlanModeV2Tool.ts:264-313).
//! - leader's `SendMessage` reply serializes [`PlanApprovalResponse`]
//!   into the teammate's inbox.
//!
//! Consumers (`PlanModeReminder::poll_teammate_approval` +
//! `inject_leader_pending_approvals`) deserialize back to these typed
//! structs — avoids string-keyed `serde_json::Value` access on internal
//! coco↔coco payloads per CLAUDE.md "Typed Structs over JSON Values".
//!
//! Wire format intentionally mirrors the TS JSON shape. Field renames
//! are explicit so both TS-originated messages (camelCase) and
//! Rust-originated messages (either style) round-trip cleanly.
