//! Bypass-permissions killswitch.
//!
//! TS: utils/permissions/bypassPermissionsKillswitch.ts
//!
//! An emergency override that forcibly disables `BypassPermissions` mode
//! regardless of settings. Two activation vectors:
//!
//! 1. **Env var** `DISABLE_BYPASS_PERMISSIONS=1` — local operator override
//!    for CI, shared workstations, or security-sensitive runs.
//! 2. **Enterprise policy** — `settings.json` field
//!    `bypassPermissionsKillswitch: true` at the policy scope
//!    (managed-settings). Overrides user/project/local settings.
//!
//! When active, any attempt to transition into `BypassPermissions` (via
//! slash command, CLI flag, or SDK control) is rejected with a clear
//! reason and the session stays in its current mode.
