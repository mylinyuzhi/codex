//! KAIROS midnight-rollover detector.
//!
//! TS parity: `getDateChangeAttachments` + `sessionTranscript.flushOnDateChange`
//! (`utils/attachments.ts:1415-1443`). TS holds a module-level
//! "last emitted date" latch and compares against `getLocalISODate()`
//! each turn; on flip it (a) emits a `date_change` attachment for the
//! model (handled separately in coco-rs via
//! [`core/system-reminder::DateChangeGenerator`]) and (b) under
//! `feature('KAIROS')` invokes the private `sessionTranscript`
//! module's per-day flush.
//!
//! This watcher owns **only** the KAIROS-side latch. The generic
//! `date_change` reminder has its own latch on the engine
//! ([`coco_state::ToolAppState::last_emitted_date`]) which fires for
//! every session regardless of mode. Two latches because they tick
//! independently: the reminder must fire on session-resume even when
//! the rollover happened while no turn was running, while the
//! KAIROS-side flush is per-turn and only meaningful inside an active
//! turn whose model can still see the new day.
//!
//! Why a sync mutex around `Option<NaiveDate>`: the slot updates on
//! every finalize-turn (low frequency), the read is constant-time,
//! and using `tokio::sync` here would force callers to hold an
//! awaitable lock across the runtime fan-out's `tokio::join!`. Plain
//! `std::sync::Mutex` keeps the lock acquisition synchronous and
//! contention-free in practice.
