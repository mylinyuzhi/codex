//! BashTool oversize-output truncation: a command whose stdout exceeds
//! `BashTool::max_result_size_chars()` (30_000) must be truncated /
//! persisted by the engine before the result feeds back into the model,
//! and the agent loop must continue normally afterward.
//!
//! Engine wiring: `coco-tool-runtime::execution` reads
//! `Tool::max_result_size_chars()` and replaces oversized content with a
//! `<persisted-output>` reference (Phase 1 stub: bash-only, parallel
//! JSON fields rather than content replacement). We don't pin the
//! exact replacement format here — only that the loop survives a 100k+
//! char output and the model still produces an assistant reply.
//!
//! Distinct from `tool_error_recovery`: that fires on a non-zero exit;
//! this one fires on a zero-exit command that simply produces too much
//! output. Different code path entirely (size budget vs error path).
