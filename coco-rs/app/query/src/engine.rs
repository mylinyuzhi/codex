/// snapshot produced by `coco-inference::process_stream_with_config`.

/// Walks `snapshot.parts` in emission order so the resulting vector
/// preserves the original text↔reasoning↔tool sequence (matters for
/// Gemini-3, which interleaves freely). Each part carries its own
/// `provider_metadata` — signatures and equivalents round-trip verbatim.
///
/// Tool-call filter: include when `is_input_complete || is_complete`.
/// Some providers (and the synthetic mock helper) only emit
/// `ToolInputStart`/`Delta`/`End` without the canonical `ToolCall(tc)`
/// close, so requiring `is_complete` would silently drop valid tool
/// calls. Malformed JSON is skipped with a `tracing::warn!`,
/// matching the previous behavior on the buffer-driven reconstruction
/// path.
