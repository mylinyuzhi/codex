//! Cross-crate `AttachmentMessage` sink for silent-event producers.
//!
//! The engine (`app/query`) owns `MessageHistory`; producer crates
//! (hooks, permissions, commands, core/tool-runtime, skills) push typed
//! `Message::Attachment` entries through an mpsc channel, drained at
//! the head of each outer-loop turn.
//!
//! Emitters are instance-scoped — the engine constructs one per session
//! and threads a clone through to each producer's context (e.g.
//! `OrchestrationContext::attachment_emitter`). Tests and standalone
//! callers use [`AttachmentEmitter::noop`].
//!
//! `emit()` is fire-and-forget: a closed channel or noop sink silently
//! drops — a missed silent event must never panic a producer. The
//! unbounded channel is intentional so a slow receiver can't back-pressure
//! a hook; producer cadence is bounded by tool execution.
