//! Autocomplete systems for input suggestions.
//!
//! Three trigger families:
//! - `/` (slash command) — synchronous, ranked from session command list
//! - `@` (unified mention) — agents (sync) + file paths (async) + MCP
//!   resources (planned). See [`unified`] for the merge order.
//! - `@#` (LSP symbol) — debounced async (100 ms), cancel-on-change.
//!
//! Removed in this refactor: the legacy `@agent-<name>` sub-prefix. Agents
//! fall out of the unified `@` pool.
