//! Live, in-process view of a sub-agent's in-flight message history.
//!
//! TS: `services/AgentSummary/agentSummary.ts` reads a running agent's
//! transcript each tick via `getAgentTranscript(agentId)`. coco-rs ships no
//! global agent-transcript registry, so the coordinator threads a
//! [`LiveTranscript`] handle into the spawn's
//! [`crate::AgentQueryConfig::live_transcript`]; the child engine publishes a
//! post-turn snapshot into it and the periodic AgentSummary timer reads it.

/// the sole reader — it calls [`Self::snapshot`] each tick. One handle is
/// minted per spawn and never shared globally, so this is not a global mutable
/// singleton.
