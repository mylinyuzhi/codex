"""End-to-end: one-shot ``query()`` against deepseek-v4-flash.

Spawns ``coco sdk --model deepseek-openai/deepseek-v4-flash``, sends a
trivial prompt, and asserts that:

* the session starts,
* at least one assistant text delta arrives,
* the turn finishes with usage > 0.

Skips cleanly when ``DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`` is missing.
