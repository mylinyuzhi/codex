//! Command result interpretation based on exit-code semantics.
//!
//! Many commands use non-zero exit codes for expected outcomes (`grep` returns
//! 1 for "no match", `diff` returns 1 for "files differ"). This interprets the
//! exit code in the context of the command that produced it, mirroring TS
//! `tools/BashTool/commandSemantics.ts`.

/// Interpretation of a command's exit code — mirrors the TS `CommandSemantic`
/// return shape `{ isError, message }`.
///
/// `is_error` drives the model-facing `Exit code N` annotation, which is
/// appended ONLY when `is_error` is true (TS `BashTool.tsx:696-700`). `message`
/// is the human-friendly explanation surfaced to the TUI only — never to the
/// model (TS `returnCodeInterpretation`).
