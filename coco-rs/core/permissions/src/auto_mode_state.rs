//! Session-scoped auto-mode state.
//!
//! TS: utils/permissions/autoModeState.ts (39 LOC)
//!
//! Three boolean flags controlling auto-mode lifecycle:
//! - `active`: whether the classifier runs on tool calls
//! - `cli_flag`: whether `--auto` was passed at startup
//! - `circuit_broken`: set by remote config gate check
//!
//! Uses `AtomicBool` for lock-free hot-path reads. The `is_active()` check
//! runs on every tool call; `set_active()` is rare (mode transitions only).
