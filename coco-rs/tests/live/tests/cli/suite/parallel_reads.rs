//! Parallel safe-tool dispatch: model issues multiple Read calls in a
//! single turn → `StreamingToolExecutor` runs them concurrently via the
//! safe-tool batch path.
//!
//! Engine wiring: each tool implements `is_concurrency_safe(input)`.
//! Read is safe; the executor groups all safe tools in a turn and
//! dispatches via `FuturesUnordered`. Catches regressions where the
//! safe-concurrent branch falls back to sequential execution (the
//! observable signal is the count of `ToolUseStarted` events, not their
//! ordering — we trust the executor's internal scheduling).
//!
//! Path choice: `/etc/hostname` and `/etc/os-release` exist on every
//! Linux host the live suite runs on, are tiny, and are outside the
//! tempdir cwd — proving the Read tool isn't constrained to
//! `project_dir`. The model is instructed to issue both reads in a
//! single turn so the executor sees them as one batch.
