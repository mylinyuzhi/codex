# TUI Overall Design and Migration Roadmap

Status: target design for the next `coco-rs/app/tui` consolidation.

`docs/coco-rs/crate-coco-tui.md` is the current implementation baseline. This
document defines the desired direction, migration sequence, and acceptance
criteria. It uses the current `coco-rs/app/tui` implementation as the baseline,
the TypeScript project at `/lyz/codespace/3rd/claude-code` as a behavior
reference, and `codex-rs/tui` as a ratatui terminal-mechanics reference.

## Authority

| Document | Authority |
|---|---|
| `crate-coco-tui.md` | Current TUI state, current APIs, current technical debt. |
| `tui-overall-design.md` | Target architecture, migration phases, acceptance criteria. |
| `coco-rs/app/tui/CLAUDE.md` | Crate-local engineering conventions. |
| `coco-rs/commands/CLAUDE.md` | Slash-command parity, deliberate command omissions, deferred command gaps. |

When this document names something for deletion, it is target-state language.
Do not edit current code solely to match this document unless the task is in an
implementation phase.

## Goal

Converge the TUI on a single conversation workspace with explicit presentation
boundaries:

```text
CoreEvent / terminal input
        -> update
        -> AppState
        -> presentation view models
        -> ratatui widgets
```

`AppState` remains the source of facts. View models turn facts into rows,
labels, badges, scroll windows, and semantic style intents. Widgets render view
models. Effects such as opening editors, applying model changes, writing
settings, or responding to permission prompts stay in update/runner/service
code, never in render code.

The visible workspace should be organized as:

1. Header and status surface.
2. Conversation transcript.
3. Turn activity surface.
4. Input/composer surface.
5. Overlay layer.

## Non-Goals

- Do not port TS React/Ink component structure one-for-one.
- Do not copy Anthropic/Claude-only account, billing, mobile, desktop, Slack,
  GitHub App, or CCR flows unless `coco-rs` has a provider-neutral runtime
  capability for the same behavior.
- Do not re-enable mouse capture. Native terminal selection remains preferred.
- Do not embed raw OSC 8 hyperlink escapes in ratatui spans until ratatui has a
  native hyperlink primitive.
- Do not add display-only model strings that bypass `ModelRole` and structured
  provider/model bindings.

## Multi-LLM Invariants

These are hard constraints for all TUI work:

- Production model picker rows come from `SessionState.model_catalog`.
- Production provider availability comes from `SessionState.provider_statuses`.
- Current role bindings come from `SessionState.model_by_role`.
- Model selection emits `UserCommand::SetModelRole { role, provider, model_id,
  effort }`.
- No production UI infers provider from model id prefixes.
- No production UI hardcodes Anthropic model families as control flow.
- Role selection goes through `ModelRole`; add a role variant instead of adding
  a raw string field.
- Provider/model state is carried as structured provider id, provider API, model
  id, display name, role, and reasoning effort.
- If a current binding is absent from the catalog or filtered allowlist, the
  picker renders a synthetic current row instead of hiding it.
- Unavailable provider/model state remains typed until render. Do not collapse
  it to a boolean before footer and row badges are built.

## TS Mirror Contract

Use TS as a behavior reference only.

Mirror provider-neutral, user-visible behavior:

- key flow and focus order
- default focus and current-row visibility
- cancel/rollback semantics
- loading, empty, disabled, success, and failure states
- transcript-visible command results
- footer and picker hints
- row labels, descriptions, and preview behavior
- narrow-terminal behavior

Do not mirror:

- React component ownership
- Ink renderer structure
- GrowthBook/Statsig gates
- Anthropic account, billing, OAuth, CCR, or product-install paths
- Claude-specific command names unless `coco-rs` intentionally exposes a
  compatibility command

When `coco-rs` intentionally diverges, record the reason in this document or
the relevant crate note.

## Conflict Register

This table records known contradictions between the old docs, current source,
and target state. Terms in backticks may be stale outside this section and the
deletion plan.

| Item | Current source truth | Target state | Migration phase | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Old state sample listed `plan_mode: bool` | `SessionState` derives plan mode from `permission_mode == PermissionMode::Plan`. | Keep plan mode derived from permission mode. | D1 complete; code invariant ongoing. | Docs and new APIs do not add a separate plan boolean. |
| Old state sample listed `file_suggestions` and `skill_suggestions` | `UiState` uses one `active_suggestions: Option<ActiveSuggestions>`. | Preserve a single suggestion state machine. | D1 complete; I10 preserves. | No new per-kind suggestion state. |
| Old command sample listed `MouseScroll` / `MouseClick` | `TuiEvent` has no mouse variant and `terminal.rs` never enables mouse capture. | Mouse capture remains disabled. | D1 complete; I3a codifies. | No `EnableMouseCapture`; mouse events are dropped defensively. |
| Memory prefix path | `PromptMode::Memory`, `UserCommand::SubmitMemory`, `TuiOnlyEvent::MemorySaved`, and `MessageContent::MemoryInput` exist. | Remove the prefix path. `/memory` is the only memory editing entrypoint. | I1 | Prefix text is ordinary chat; deleted APIs have no production call sites. |
| Direct memory append | `tui_runner::run_prompt_mode_memory` appends directly to `CLAUDE.md`. | Memory file edits route through `/memory` and the editor/opener service. | I1, I6, I7 | No input-bar file writes. |
| Memory dialog payload | `OpenMemoryDialog` carries path/label/scope rows. | Add row-kind-aware `MemoryPickerRow` payload. | I7 | Renderer consumes typed rows, not path/label/scope-only rows. |
| Render reads runtime helper | `render.rs` calls a typed env helper for coordinator display. | Display decisions are folded into state/view model before render. | I2, I9 | Render is deterministic from state plus frame area. |
| Input rendering duplication | `render.rs::render_input` and `widgets/input.rs` both know prompt titles, prefix stripping, and styling. | One input view model and renderer owns composer presentation. | I10 | Duplicate rendering path removed. |
| Direct theme reads | Most widgets and overlay renderers read `Theme` fields directly. | New presentation code reads semantic `UiStyles`; old code migrates incrementally. | I2, I3d | New widgets do not reach into `theme.X` directly. |
| Model fallback inference | `update/show.rs` can infer provider from builtin model id when catalog is empty. | Fallback constrained to tests/pre-bootstrap only. Production uses session catalog. | I4 | Production path has no model-prefix provider inference. |
| `/fast` TS command | `commands/CLAUDE.md` marks TS `/fast` deliberately not ported. TUI has `ToggleFastMode` and runtime `FastModeState`. | Do not add TS `/fast` account/product flow. Expose provider-neutral fast state only where runtime supports it. | I11 | Command audit marks omission or provider-neutral replacement. |
| `/login`, `/logout` | Deliberately omitted as Anthropic account flows. | No provider-generic login surface until provider crates expose one. | I11 | Audit marks deliberate omission. |
| TS `terminalSetup` / `/terminal-setup` | Deliberately omitted as Anthropic `claude` CLI binding installer. | No direct port. | I11 | Audit marks deliberate omission. |
| Pending command dialogs | Some `DialogSpec` variants emit dialog-pending status. | Add typed overlays or document intentional non-support. | I11 | No silent dialog gaps. |
| OSC 8 links | ratatui spans do not support native hyperlinks. | Deferred. | I3a | No raw escape workaround in render code. |

## Public Interface Classification

### Current Long-Term Interface

Keep:

```rust
UserCommand::SetModelRole {
    role: ModelRole,
    provider: String,
    model_id: String,
    effort: Option<ReasoningEffort>,
}
```

This remains the model-switching boundary for the TUI.

### Target Additions or Extensions

Add or expand:

- `UiStyles`
- presentation view models
- `PickerScaffold`
- `FuzzyPicker`
- `OverlayFrame`
- `MemoryPickerRow`
- row-kind-aware `OpenMemoryDialog` payload
- external editor/open intent and service boundary
- typed permission/request/MCP view models
- transcript/activity/diff/pager view models

### Migration-Only Compatibility

These exist today but should not be documented as long-term design:

- legacy memory prefix APIs listed in the memory deletion plan
- path/label/scope-only memory dialog rows
- model-prefix provider inference fallback

## Memory Deletion Plan

Remove these target-deleted surfaces together:

- `PromptMode::Memory`
- `UserCommand::SubmitMemory`
- `TuiOnlyEvent::MemorySaved`
- `MessageContent::MemoryInput`
- legacy help text that suggests `#note`
- prompt-mode direct append to `CLAUDE.md`

Acceptance:

- `#` at the start of input is ordinary chat text.
- `/memory` is the only memory editing entrypoint.
- Memory edit success, cancellation, and failure are transcript-visible command
  results. Toasts may duplicate but cannot be the only feedback.

## Target Presentation Modules

Add a pure presentation layer under `app/tui/src/presentation/` as migration
work needs it:

```text
presentation/
  mod.rs
  styles.rs
  layout.rs
  renderable.rs
  surface_stack.rs
  picker.rs
  footer.rs
  notifications.rs
  dialogs.rs
  model_picker.rs
  memory_picker.rs
  permissions.rs
  conversation.rs
  streaming.rs
  pager.rs
  activity.rs
  input.rs
  suggestions.rs
  status.rs
  diff.rs
  terminal.rs
  command_surfaces.rs
```

This list is a target map, not a mandate to create empty modules. Add modules
when a phase needs them.

## Phase D0-D2: Documentation

| Phase | Work | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| D0 | Audit current docs and current source. | Authority relationship is explicit. |
| D1 | Rewrite `crate-coco-tui.md` as current-state baseline. | Current state no longer contains stale copied enums or outdated state samples. |
| D2 | Rewrite this document as target design and roadmap. | Conflicts, target APIs, multi-LLM invariants, and command boundaries are explicit. |

## Phase I0: TS Behavior Inventory

Before rewriting an interactive surface, capture the TS behavior to mirror:

- keybindings and focus order
- default focus/current-row behavior
- Enter, Tab, Shift-Tab, Escape, Ctrl-C, Up/Down, PageUp/PageDown behavior
- loading, empty, disabled, cancel, success, and failure text
- transcript result versus toast-only feedback
- preview and rollback behavior
- narrow-terminal behavior

Acceptance:

- Each migrated interactive command has a short behavior note or fixture.
- Intentional divergences are visible before implementation.
- Tests are named for behavior, not private implementation details.

## Phase I1: Remove Memory Prefix Mode

Touch points:

- `app/tui/src/state/ui.rs`
- `app/tui/src/update/edit.rs`
- `app/tui/src/command.rs`
- `app/cli/src/tui_runner.rs`
- `common/types/src/event.rs`
- `app/tui/src/state/session.rs`
- `app/tui/src/widgets/chat/render_user.rs`
- `app/tui/src/render_overlays/help.rs`
- locale strings and companion tests

Acceptance:

- Leading `#` is normal input.
- No prompt-mode append to `CLAUDE.md`.
- `/memory` remains available.
- Deleted compatibility types are absent from production paths.

## Phase I2: Presentation Boundary and Minimal UiStyles

Add the first minimal presentation boundary:

- `presentation/styles.rs`
- a small `UiStyles` facade over the existing `Theme`
- one or two presentation view models for new/migrated surfaces

This phase is intentionally small. It establishes the boundary; it does not
attempt to replace every direct `Theme` read.

Acceptance:

- New UI code uses semantic style methods.
- Existing custom themes and hot reload still work.
- No new `Theme` field is added unless existing fields cannot express the
  semantic intent.

## Phase I3: Shared Presentation Primitives

Split the primitive work into committable subphases.

### I3a: Layout and Terminal Helpers

- positive-width guards
- Unicode-width-aware truncation
- terminal capability resolver
- keybinding fallback table
- mouse capture explicitly remains off
- OSC 8 hyperlinks remain deferred

Acceptance:

- Narrow/normal/wide snapshots for touched surfaces.
- No render code receives zero-width wrap regions.

### I3b: Renderable Contract

Add a small measurement/render trait for complex presentation surfaces:

```rust
pub trait UiRenderable {
    fn display_lines(&self, width: u16) -> Vec<Line<'static>>;
    fn transcript_lines(&self, width: u16) -> Vec<Line<'static>> {
        self.display_lines(width)
    }
    fn desired_height(&self, width: u16) -> u16;
    fn render(&self, area: Rect, buf: &mut Buffer);
    fn cursor(&self, area: Rect) -> Option<UiCursor> { None }
}
```

Acceptance:

- Two or three simple transcript cells migrate first.
- Measure and draw use the same wrapping assumptions.

### I3c: Surface Stack

Add a focused transient surface stack that reconciles with the existing overlay
priority queue.

Rules:

- `Overlay` remains domain state and priority authority.
- The surface stack routes focus and local keys.
- Composer text, cursor, pasted ids, images, stash state, and queue state
  survive while a surface is active.
- Key routing order is focused surface, keybinding context, composer, global.

Acceptance:

- Existing `Overlay::priority` tiers and `MAX_OVERLAY_QUEUE` behavior are
  preserved.
- Ctrl-C/Escape remain local to confirmation surfaces when appropriate.

### I3d: Footer, Notifications, Dialog Frame, Style Coverage

- pure footer props with width-collapse priority
- notification display rows and severity style intents
- shared dialog frame
- expanded `UiStyles` coverage for chrome, intent, picker, footer, and dialog
  semantics used by these primitives

Acceptance:

- Footer hints do not overlap on narrow terminals.
- Notification delivery remains in `widgets/notification.rs`.
- New dialog/picker primitives do not read `Theme` directly.

## Phase I4: Multi-LLM Model Picker

Target behavior:

- role axis: Main, Fast, Plan, Explore, Review, HookAgent, Memory, Subagent
- model axis: provider-grouped entries
- effort axis: supported reasoning efforts for the focused model
- typed unavailable rows
- synthetic current rows when needed
- no production provider inference from model id
- fast-mode state visible in footer/hints when relevant

Acceptance:

- Picker rows come from `SessionState.model_catalog`.
- Provider status comes from `SessionState.provider_statuses`.
- Current state comes from `SessionState.model_by_role`.
- Confirm emits `UserCommand::SetModelRole`.
- Tests cover absent-current-row preservation, unavailable reasons, effort
  downgrade, and filtered selection.

## Phase I5: Typed Permission, Request, and MCP Surfaces

Move permission and request surfaces from string-body overlays toward typed
view models:

- tool-specific permission views
- plan entry/exit approval
- request-user-input / AskUserQuestion forms
- MCP elicitation forms
- long content through pager/sticky footer

Acceptance:

- Shared prompt mechanics support options, feedback, cancellation, and
  classifier state.
- Escape/Ctrl-C cancel locally where TS behavior does.
- Long diffs and plans remain reviewable without hiding response options.

## Phase I6: External Editor and Opener Service

Replace direct editor spawning with one boundary that:

- resolves `$VISUAL || $EDITOR || vi`
- parses command and arguments with a real parser
- suspends raw mode and alternate screen when needed
- waits for terminal editors
- restores the TUI
- returns structured success/cancel/failure results

Acceptance:

- Widgets and renderers never spawn processes.
- Prompt editor, plan editor, `/memory`, and future opener flows share the
  service.
- Results can be rendered in transcript and toast surfaces.

## Phase I7: Rebuild Memory Picker

Expand the dialog/event payload before migrating the renderer:

```rust
pub enum MemoryPickerRow {
    File {
        scope: MemoryScope,
        path: PathBuf,
        label: String,
        description: String,
        exists: bool,
        depth: usize,
        imported_from: Option<PathBuf>,
    },
    Folder {
        kind: MemoryFolderKind,
        path: PathBuf,
        label: String,
        description: String,
    },
    Toggle {
        kind: MemoryToggleKind,
        label: String,
        description: String,
        enabled: bool,
        editable: bool,
    },
}
```

Minimum rows:

- managed memory file entries
- user memory entry, including missing-file state
- project memory entry, including missing-file state
- project-local entry where applicable
- subdirectory/imported child entries with indentation/depth
- auto-memory folder/toggle rows when the runtime exposes them

Acceptance:

- Renderer consumes `MemoryPickerRow`.
- File creation uses create-exclusive semantics.
- Folder selection creates missing folder before open when needed.
- Success, cancellation, and failure are transcript-visible.
- `/memory refresh` or list-only compatibility is either removed or folded into
  the picker flow.

## Phase I8: Conversation, Diff, and Pager

Add shared view models for:

- committed transcript cells
- active streaming tail
- full transcript pager
- help/status/detail pagers
- structured diff rows

Acceptance:

- Committed history and active streaming have distinct contracts.
- Resize re-renders from source, not from previously wrapped lines.
- Large diffs use pager/sticky footer instead of overflowing the active
  overlay.

## Phase I9: Unified Activity Surface

Add `TurnActivityView` for live state:

- thinking activity
- queued/running tools
- tool progress
- subagent tree
- background tasks
- plan/todo progress
- stream stall or interrupt state

Acceptance:

- The side panel renders one activity view model.
- Top-level render no longer chooses between business-specific panels.
- Feature/env/config decisions are resolved before render.

## Phase I10: Input, Suggestions, and Footer Unification

Collapse input rendering and suggestion/footer logic:

- one input view model
- one input renderer
- one suggestion row model
- pure footer props
- prompt suggestions and queued command hints use the same focus model

Acceptance:

- Prefix stripping and visual cursor math live in one place.
- The legacy memory prefix cannot reappear accidentally.
- Pasted content, images, stash, history, queued input, and suggestions are
  tested together.

## Phase I11: Slash Command Surface Parity

Interactive slash commands should return typed command surfaces and
transcript-visible command results when `coco-rs` has an equivalent backend.

Mirror or implement provider-neutral UI when supported:

- `/model`, `/memory`, `/theme`, `/config`, `/output-style`
- `/permissions`, `/sandbox`, `/mcp`
- `/agents`, `/tasks`, `/session`, `/resume`
- `/context`, `/status`, `/diff`, `/export`, `/help`
- `/hooks`, `/plugins`, `/skills`, `/keybindings`
- `/add-dir`, `/ide`, `/rewind`, `/doctor`

Use compatibility text, deliberate omission, or backend-unsupported status for
TS/product-specific commands:

| Command | Target classification |
|---|---|
| `/login`, `/logout` | Deliberate omission until provider-neutral auth UI exists. |
| `/fast` | Deliberate omission as TS slash command; expose runtime fast state through provider-neutral TUI controls only. |
| `/terminal-setup` / TS `terminalSetup` | Deliberate omission; Anthropic `claude` CLI binding installer. |
| `/privacy-settings`, `/rate-limit-options`, `/reset-limits`, `/extra-usage` | Product/account-specific unless `coco-rs` exposes provider-neutral equivalents. |
| `/install-github-app`, `/install-slack-app`, `/mobile`, `/desktop`, `/chrome`, `/passes` | Product/platform-specific deliberate omissions. |
| `/ultraplan`, `/ultrareview`, `/advisor`, `/voice`, `/think-back`, `/thinkback-play` | Anthropic/CCR/internal or experimental backend-specific omissions. |

Acceptance:

- A checked-in command audit accounts for every TS command name as implemented,
  alias/compat-message, backend unsupported, or intentionally omitted.
- No TS-only command is treated as a missing TUI bug without checking
  `commands/CLAUDE.md`.

## Design Rules

- Render functions are pure from `AppState`/view model plus frame area.
- Widgets do not perform filesystem, process, config, network, or runtime
  side effects.
- Update and runner code own behavior and effects.
- Closed UI states use typed enums or structs, not unstructured
  `serde_json::Value`, when producer and consumer are both in `coco-rs`.
- Complex surfaces measure before rendering.
- Terminal-specific behavior is centralized.
- User-visible command outcomes are transcript-visible; toasts are not the
  only durable result.
- Use i18n keys for labels and hints.
- Use snapshots for visible UI changes.
- Keep files under local module-size guidance; split before creating another
  render dumping ground.

## Verification

Documentation-only verification:

- Run the stale-term `rg` check from the task plan against these two docs.
  Legacy terms should appear only in a conflict register or deletion plan.
- Run a source `rg` check for the current memory and model APIs named by this
  roadmap, then compare the hits against `app/tui/CLAUDE.md`,
  `commands/CLAUDE.md`, `common/types/src/event.rs`, and
  `app/cli/src/tui_runner.rs`.

Implementation-phase verification:

- TUI-only change: `just quick-check` and `just test-crate coco-tui`.
- Command/event type change: add `just test-crate coco-commands` or broader
  `just test` when shared crates are affected.
- Visible UI change: add/update focused `insta` snapshots at narrow, normal,
  and wide widths where relevant.
- Final commit gate: run `just pre-commit` once at the end.
