//! `app:toggleTodos` handler — cycle the right-rail expanded view.
//!
//! Mirrors TS `useGlobalKeybindings.tsx::handleToggleTodos`
//! (lines 51-89). Three-state cycle when there are running teammates,
//! two-state otherwise:
//!
//! * has running teammates: `None → Tasks → Teammates → None`
//! * else: `None ↔ Tasks`
//!
//! The Teammates branch is skipped when `subagents` is empty so the
//! cycle doesn't waste a keystroke landing on an empty pane.
